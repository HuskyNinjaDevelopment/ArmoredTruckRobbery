# Add/Remove Locations
All the locations the truck can spawn and all the locations the truck can drive to are stored in the coords.json file included along with the release. Simply add the coordinates to the group related to the position you want to add.

Note: For all start coordinates the W value is the heading the truck is to face when it is spawned in. For all end coordinates the W value is always 0.
